## iOS Port Status (commit a1d62f2)

### ✅ Implemented
- [x] iOS directory structure + CMake iOS detection (`CMakeLists.txt`)
- [x] iOS target in `vita3k/CMakeLists.txt` (SHARED lib + MoltenVK via vcpkg)
- [x] SwiftUI + Metal UI layer (`Vita3KApp.swift`, `ContentView.swift`, `Renderer.swift`)
- [x] Native bridge (`EmulatorBridge.h/mm`, `NativeLib.swift`)
- [x] StikDebug JIT hook point (`StikDebugJIT.swift`)
- [x] "More RAM" feature – Increased Memory Limit + get-task-allow flow
  - `MoreRAMView.swift` + `MoreRAMViewModel.swift`
  - StosSign + Anisette login + PATCH to Apple Developer API
  - Keychain + DataManager scaffolding
- [x] GitHub Actions CI (`ios-build.yml`)
  - Ninja + Xcode dual build
  - vcpkg caching (`actions/cache`)
  - IPA export path ready

### 🚧 Planned / In Progress
- [ ] Full Anisette login UI (copy from SideStore/GetMoreRam)
- [ ] Real Metal/MoltenVK surface creation in MTKView
- [ ] Input overlay + audio + filesystem iOS implementations
- [ ] StikDebug JIT entitlement grant at runtime
- [ ] Proper Xcode project generation / `ExportOptions.plist` signing
- [ ] App Store / TestFlight distribution (manual signing only)

### 🔜 Future
- [ ] Native Metal renderer backend (optional, Vulkan via MoltenVK works)
- [ ] On-device game installation + trophy support
- [ ] Performance overlays and settings

**Note**: The "More RAM" feature requires the user to log in with the same Apple ID used to sign the app, then re-sign after enabling the capability (same flow as GetMoreRam).

## Note
The purpose of this emulator is not to enable illegal activity. You can dump games from a Vita by using [NoNpDrm](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm) or [FAGDec](https://github.com/CelesteBlue-dev/PSVita-RE-tools/tree/master/FAGDec/build). You can get homebrew programs from [VitaDB](https://www.rinnegatamante.eu/vitadb/#/).
